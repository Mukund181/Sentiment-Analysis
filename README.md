This project implements a Mental Health Sentiment Analysis tool that uses BERT (Bidirectional Encoder Representations from Transformers) to analyze social media posts, 
tweets, or any user-generated text. The model predicts whether the sentiment behind the text is positive, neutral, or negative. This tool can help identify emotional trends
in digital conversations, raising awareness of mental health issues in online platforms.

Sentiment Classification: The model predicts whether the sentiment of a given text is positive, neutral, or negative.
BERT-based Model: Utilizes pre-trained BERT from the Hugging Face Transformers library to understand the context of the text.
User Input: Takes social media post or any text input from the user and classifies its sentiment.
Text Analysis: Helps in analyzing mental health-related discussions online.

TensorFlow: For implementing the model.
Hugging Face Transformers: Pre-trained BERT model for sequence classification.
Scikit-learn: For preprocessing the data and model evaluation.
NumPy and Pandas: For handling data operations.
